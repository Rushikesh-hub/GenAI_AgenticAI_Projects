Prompt Engineering Best Practices
===================================

Prompt engineering is crafting LLM inputs to elicit accurate,
relevant, and useful outputs.

Core techniques:

1. Zero-Shot Prompting — direct task, no examples.

2. Few-Shot Prompting — 2-5 worked examples before the task.
   Significantly improves accuracy on complex tasks.

3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) — 'Think step by step...'
   Best for math, logic, multi-step reasoning.

4. System Prompt vs User Prompt:
   System: persona, rules, constraints (set once).
   User: the actual question (changes per request).

5. RAG-specific prompting tips:
   - Tell the model to answer ONLY from the provided context.
   - Instruct it to say 'I don't know' if context is insufficient.
   - Request citations: 'Quote the relevant passage from context.'
